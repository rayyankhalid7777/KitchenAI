# Cooking Up Data: Understanding Recipe Ratings and Preferences

Author: Rayyan Khalid

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze factors that impact the average ratings of recipes and predict future ratings based on recipe attributes such as the number of ingredients, preparation steps, and calorie content. Using a dataset of over 80,000 recipes and user interactions, we clean and explore the data, test hypotheses, build predictive models, and ensure fairness in predictions across recipe categories. This project not only highlights trends in recipe preferences but also addresses the challenges of creating equitable models for diverse data.
